# Hooks general rules
- begins with 'use';
- component name must be uppercase;
- must be in the function/component body;
- cannot call conditionally; ( cannot be in if else ).

# Why use keys in lists
- Keys help React identify which items have changed (added/removed/re-ordered).
  To give a unique identity to every element inside the array, a key is required.

# useState
- returns a default state value and function. Function controls the value that we have in our state. 
- preserves the value and triggers re render.

# useEffect
- by default runs after every re-render; (every time we render our component)
- cleanup function;
- second parameter;
- it is used to implement work outside of the componenet. Like data fetching, listening for events.
- If we only want to run useEffect on initial render we add second argument and the argument is an empy array.
- If we pass a value in second parameter and if the value changes, useEffect will run.

# Short-Cicuit evaluation
- for OR operator if left value is false then it will return right value.
- for AND operator if left value is true it will return right value.
